### `My business topics`
Before Corona, I was on the road a lot and spoke about Azure topics at countless Azure Meetups. Now that things are slowly getting back to normal, I maybe want to get involved in this area again. 

But the last two years have brought me a different focus. I won't be auditioning all topics today, but I will focus on a few topics.

In various customer projects I came across the topic of strategy again and again.

Many of my customers simply started with the cloud without really having a plan for it. 

This is exactly where I would like to start. As of this I want to discuss with you your strategic it journey.

**NO 🚀 science ;-)**
